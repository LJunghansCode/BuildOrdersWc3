## Getting Started
First go to `./server/config/config.js-replace-me` and follow the instructions there to
build your .gitignore'd config.js file.

Next run `npm install` in the root directory to build your node_modules. From there run

```bash
node server.js
```

to run the server and then it will tell you where to go.
