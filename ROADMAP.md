# Roadmap

Here is how I believe we should approach the reshaping, launch, and marketing of needmorelumber.com.

## 1. Refactor + rewrite site to MVP
See github issues for everything involved. More or less, this is:
- The LIST page (/builds) should allow more elements + description per row item. It needs pagination.
- we need to add a DISPLAY page for each individual build so it can be linked to.
- Refactor `builds` model to have a simple `{food, description}` structure so that content creators can more easily add build orders.
- Dark code the real time build order executor as it isn't need for a minimally viable product market fit. Right now the market demand is for a site that just has a lot of build orders.
- Change homepage to /builds as that's the relevant content people want to see and will search for.

## 2. SEO visibility
- Add sitemap
- Add more static copy referencing searched keywords like "wc3 build orders"
- Add html meta tags to header
- Add schema.org JSON-LD (optional)

## 3. Build your inventory!
We need to add something on the order of 30-50 VALID build orders that people would actually use. Without
inventory the site will be ignored. I will probably watch pro vods / stream vods / replays and annotate these myself.


## 4. Reach out to community members
It'd be great if we could have people like Grubby and notable community figures adding things like a BotW (build of the week) to needmorelumber.com.
It's cool if they won't or don't want to. But I think our intentions are pure here that I want there to be a resource
like spawningtool.com but for wc3 in time for Reforged's launch and there being an influx of new players, a lot of whom
are accustomed to widely available free build orders. So I would probably pitch with that and hope
that they agree with the missive and want to help in the small way they can.
